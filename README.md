Poseidon is just a small collection of R scripts that allow readers to reproduce the sensitivity tests described in this study, and to run numerical experiments of their own. Users are referred to the paper for background, rationale, and examples. To set up and run Poseidon simulations, see the “runPoseidon.R” script.
